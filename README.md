# Banking-Domain-Analysis
 
 This banking domain analysis project leverages a comprehensive tech stack of Python, SQL, and Power BI to deliver actionable insights into financial operations, customer behavior, and transactional patterns. The solution encompasses data processing with Python (using Pandas/Numpy for manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization), SQL for robust data management and querying, and Power BI for interactive dashboards and reporting. The project structure is organized into directories for data (raw/processed datasets and SQL scripts), Jupyter notebooks (for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering), Python scripts (ETL pipelines, database utilities, and analytical functions), and Power BI files (including the dashboard and data model). It supports various banking data sources like customer demographics, account information, transaction records, and loan details. Setup requires Python 3.8+, a SQL database (SQL Server/MySQL/PostgreSQL), and Power BI Desktop, with installation steps involving cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies via requirements.txt, and configuring the database schema using provided SQL scripts. The solution enables banks to monitor financial health, detect trends, and optimize operations through data-driven decision-making
