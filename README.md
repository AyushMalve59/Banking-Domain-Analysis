# Banking-Domain-Analysis
 
 This banking domain analysis project leverages a comprehensive tech stack of Python, SQL, and Power BI to deliver actionable insights into financial operations, customer behavior, and transactional patterns. The solution encompasses data processing with Python (using Pandas/Numpy for manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization), SQL for robust data management and querying, and Power BI for interactive dashboards and reporting. The project structure is organized into directories for data (raw/processed datasets and SQL scripts), Jupyter notebooks (for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering), Python scripts (ETL pipelines, database utilities, and analytical functions), and Power BI files (including the dashboard and data model). It supports various banking data sources like customer demographics, account information, transaction records, and loan details. Setup requires Python 3.8+, a SQL database (SQL Server/MySQL/PostgreSQL), and Power BI Desktop, with installation steps involving cloning the repository, creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies via requirements.txt, and configuring the database schema using provided SQL scripts. The solution enables banks to monitor financial health, detect trends, and optimize operations through data-driven decision-making 
 
 
 üìå Overview
This project focuses on analyzing banking domain data to derive actionable insights for decision-making. The workflow includes:

Data Extraction & Cleaning (Python)

Data Analysis & Transformation (SQL)

Interactive Visualizations (Power BI)

The goal is to provide banks with insights into customer behavior, transaction trends, risk assessment, and revenue optimization.

üìä Data Sources
The dataset includes:

Customer Information (ID, Name, Age, Location)

Account Details (Account ID, Type, Balance, Open Date)

Transaction Records (Transaction ID, Amount, Date, Type)

Loan Data (Loan ID, Amount, Interest Rate, Status)

(Sample datasets can be sourced from Kaggle or synthetic data generation.)

üöÄ Workflow Steps
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Extraction & Cleaning (Python)
üìå Script: scripts/data_cleaning.py

Load raw data using Pandas.

Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect formats.

Feature engineering (e.g., calculating customer tenure).

Export cleaned data to CSV/SQL database.

python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("data/raw_data.csv")

# Clean data
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)
df.fillna({"balance": 0}, inplace=True)

# Save cleaned data
df.to_csv("data/cleaned_data.csv", index=False)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis (SQL)
üìå Script: scripts/sql_queries.sql

Perform aggregations (total balance, avg transaction amount).

Identify high-value customers.

Detect fraudulent transactions.

Analyze loan defaulters
